## Session Overview ##
The Rogue Cloud is an interactive session where students can learn how to develop video games and applications hosted in local and cloud scenarios. Through the session, students can understand how to use tools to support their development environment. Moreover, they will have hands-on experience by interacting with each other and developing some features for a video game called Rogue Cloud, which is a 2D multiplayer game. Using Rogue Cloud, students will be able to create and modify game elements and see their changes real-time within the video game.

## Codewind Overview ##
Codewind simplifies and enhances development in containers by extending industry standard IDEs with features to write, debug, and deploy cloud-native applications.

## Rogue Cloud ##
Rogue Cloud is an open-world top-down 2D multiplayer game, but unlike a traditional game where you control it with a controller, keyboard, or mouse, with Rogue Cloud you are actually writing code to control your character as it interacts with a vast, dangerous game world. Behind the scenes the code that you write is packaged into a WebSocket-based microservice, which like a traditional microservice, provides or supports a variety of cloud-native requirements.
