## Session Overview ##
The Rogue Cloud is an interactive session where students can learn how to develop video games and applications hosted in local and cloud scenarios. Through the session, students can understand how to use tools to support their development environment. Moreover, they will have hands-on experience by interacting with each other and developing some features for a video game called Rogue Cloud, which is a 2D multiplayer game. Using Rogue Cloud, students will be able to create and modify game elements and see their changes real-time within the video game.


## Codewind Overview ##
Codewind simplifies and enhances development in containers by extending industry standard IDEs with features to write, debug, and deploy cloud-native applications.

## Rogue Cloud ##
Rogue Cloud is an open-world top-down 2D multiplayer game. Unlike a traditional game where you control it with a controller, keyboard, or mouse, with Rouge Cloud, you actually write code to control your character as it interacts with a vast, dangerous game world. Behind the scenes, the code that you write is packaged into a WebSocket-based microservice, which like a traditional microservice, provides or supports a variety of cloud-native requirements.


### Getting Started ###
1. [Play Rogue Cloud using Codewind for VS Code](https://github.com/sujeilyfonseca/rogue-cloud-interactive-session/blob/master/docs/developing-vscode-codewind.md)
2. [Play Rogue Cloud using Codewind for Eclipse](https://github.com/sujeilyfonseca/rogue-cloud-interactive-session/blob/master/docs/developing-eclipse-codewind.md)


### The Technology Behind the Game ###
Building microservices and cloud-native applications requires tools that lets developers rapidly develop and deploy applications to the cloud.

* Learn more about [Eclipse Codewind](https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/), which is IBM's open source container-based development tools driving end-to-end delivery and rapid iteration of Java/Node/Swift/Go/Python/Docker/Appsody application development.

Rogue Cloud is built on Open Liberty, the premier platform for building Java cloud-native applications and microservices.

* Learn more about the latest and greatest [open source enterprise application server](https://openliberty.io).
Rogue Cloud is designed to showcase the capabilities of the Kubernetes-based **IBM Cloud Private** and the public **IBM Cloud Kubernetes** services.

* Learn more about deploying your containers to Kubernetes using the [IBM Cloud Private](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/private) and the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service) services.
